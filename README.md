This program makes use of the concepts learned in CIS-18A: Java Programming such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.  

Upon runtime, this program generates a GUI window for users to input their address and contact information and make appointments for 
aquarium maintenance services.  All customer information is saved to a text file to maintain persistent data.

All GUI components are generated using the Java Swing library.

This program uses the LGoodDateTimePicker library at https://github.com/LGoodDatePicker/LGoodDatePicker.
